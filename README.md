# My Personal Site

Initial planning and set up of my personal site which I will use to play with new technologies and try to keep up with my goals for the year

Most definitely a work in progress - the only thing I know so far is that I am using ReactJS :slightly_smiling_face:

It's also a project to play around with the project management features of GitHub - even for a personal project.
